## Environment

First we install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the root folder with the following variables and replace the values with your test blockchain accounts private keys. It's recommended to use different accounts than the ones you use for mainnet.

```
TESTNET_ACCOUNT_1=[private key 1]
TESTNET_ACCOUNT_2=[private key 2]
TESTNET_ACCOUNT_3=[private key 3]
TESTNET_ACCOUNT_4=[private key 4]
TESTNET_ACCOUNT_5=[private key 5]
```
